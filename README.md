**TIC-TAC-TOE SQUARED**
This Java game runs in command line, and takes text input to play not just tic-tac-toe, but TTT squared! The board consists of 9 regions, each containing an individual TTT game. 
Rules to play can be found [online](https://www.thegamegal.com/2018/09/01/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/), and a cute endgame message is displayed to the winner upon completion of the game.
